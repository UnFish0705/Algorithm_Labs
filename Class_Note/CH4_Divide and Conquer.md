# CH4_Divide and Conquer
In this chapter, we revisit and deepen our understanding on the divide-and-conquer approach for designing algorithms,  
and learn different method for solving recurrences characterizing running time of divide-and-conquer algorithms.

### Soving the maximun-subarray problem
Recall that the method of divide-and-conquer consists of, at each level of the recursion, the three steps:
1. divide a problem into subproblems.
2. conquer**(recursively)** the subproblems.
3. combine the solutions of the subproblems and obtain a solution for the original problem. 
We will use this design method to design an efficient algorithms to solve the following problem.
